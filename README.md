# Process :
     
 The process included:

   1. Data Collection: Gathered raw bank loan data (customer details, loan amount, purpose, state, and repayment info).

   2. Data Cleaning: Removed duplicates, handled missing values, standardized column names, and verified data consistency 
      using Excel Power Query and MySQL.

   3. Data Transformation: Created calculated columns for total loan amount, interest rate, and DTI.

   4. Data Loading: Imported the cleaned data into Power BI.

   5. Dashboard Development: Built KPIs, charts, and slicers to create interactive visualizations.

   6. Validation: Cross-checked totals and trends to ensure accuracy.

  7. Presentation: Finalized color scheme and layout for clear storytelling.

   
# Project Insights :
     
   Loan Growth: There was a steady increase in total loan amounts over the years, indicating expanding customer reach.

   Loan Purpose: The majority of loans were for debt consolidation, followed by credit card payments.

   State Analysis: States like CA, NY, and TX have the highest number of loans and repayments.

   Home Ownership: Customers with mortgages take the majority of loans (~47%).

   Verification Status: Around 58% of total payments come from non-verified loans, indicating potential risk in 
       verification processes.

   Grades: Grade B and A customers have the highest revolving balances, showing they hold a large share of active credit.
    
# Final Conclusion:
    
  The bank loan portfolio shows healthy growth, especially in debt consolidation and credit card segments. However, the
  high share of non-verified loans and rising revolving balances indicate a need for tighter verification and monitoring
  processes. The analysis also highlights that most loans are concentrated in a few states and among mortgage holders,
  suggesting potential opportunities for expanding into underrepresented segments.
